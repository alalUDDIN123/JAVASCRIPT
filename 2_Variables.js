//   # Variables:

//     We use programming languages like JavaScript to store and manipulate information.

//     Variables in JavaScript are used to store different kinds of data. Think of a variable
//     like a bottle. We use bottles to store water, in much the same way we use variables to
//     store various forms of data in JavaScript.

//     Example:
//     var number = 200

//     Syntax: You can also declare multiple variables in one statement as seen in the syntax
//     below.

//     Multiple Variables Example:
//     var a = 100, b = 200, c = 300;

//     The data inside variables is not constant. This means the data inside a variable can
//     be changed.

//     Example:
//     var a = 200
//     a = 100

//     In the above example the variable called a first contained the value 200 but a = 100
//     means that a now contains the value 100.
    
//     NOTE: You can name variables whatever you want but try to give them good/descriptive
//     names that tell the reader what the variable is used for
